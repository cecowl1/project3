                    <p>Shigeo Fukuda was born in 1932 to a family of toy manufacturers. This was very important because his creative thinking began at such a young age as he was influenced by what his family was doing. Unfortunately, most of his childhood was spent during the second World War but this gave him plenty of time to decide that when it was over, he wanted to go to art school.</p>
                    <p>His interest in Swiss style and design led him to choosing the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts & Music where he graduated in 1956 when he was 24 years old. He practiced graphic design in the field for almost 10 years before his work received any recognition from the public. His submission to the Czechslovkian graphic design competition was noticed by Paul Rand and many other influential graphic designers and his career took off. Soon he was parctipating in Montreal for the Expo 1967 to showcase his illusionist style and strong political messages.</p>
                    <p>His career was long and impactful to the graphic design community. His unique use of form and composition to create a universal message was very inspirational to others. Shigeo Fukuda had the ability to share his work globally across social, cultural, and linguistic backgrounds. He received many awards before passing in 2009.</p>
